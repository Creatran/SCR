\description{
The solution to the exercise 6_8 for Rizzo's Book.

Refer to Example 6.16. Repeat the simulation, but also compute the F test of equal variance, at significance level Î± = 0.055. Compare the power of the Count Five test and F test for small, medium, and large sample sizes. (Recall that the F test is not applicable for non-normal distributions.)
