# SCR
An educational use R package corresponding to Rizzo's book "Statistical Computing with R".

This the first R package that I developed. The SCR R package serves as an associate tool to help students get a deep understanding about the book 
“Statistical Computing with R”, including nearly 100 R functions implemented by me and my co-wokers Yinuo & Wenyu. 

The vignette displays the method to downlod, install, and use this package. You can find its vignette here: https://scr-vignette.netlify.app/.

Hope you find this package useful when you exploring the book "Statistical Computing with R".      
If you have any problems, please feel free to contact me. Have fun!
